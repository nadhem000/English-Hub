## About English Hub

English Hub is an interactive web platform designed to enhance communication skills through engaging, age-appropriate learning experiences. Our platform serves two main audiences: elementary school students (ages 8-15) and young adult workers (ages 18-30), providing tailored content that addresses their specific needs and real-life situations.

For younger learners, we offer fun, relatable stories about school life, friendships, and adventures that build reading comprehension and social skills. For young adults, we provide practical scenarios focused on workplace navigation, daily life tasks, and adapting to new environments in English-speaking countries.

The platform features immersive reading adventures with audio support, comprehension questions, vocabulary building exercises, and pronunciation practice. Our multi-language interface (English, French, and Arabic) ensures accessibility for diverse learners, while the responsive design works seamlessly across all devices.

Key features include:
- Interactive reading lessons with audio narration
- Real-life scenario-based learning
- Multi-language support with RTL compatibility
- Pronunciation practice with recording capabilities
- Vocabulary building with contextual examples
- Progress tracking and comprehension assessments
