        passage: {
            p1: "It was a beautiful Saturday morning. The sun was shining brightly, and the sky was clear and blue. The Johnson family decided it was the perfect day to visit their local park. Mr. Johnson packed a picnic basket with sandwiches, apples, and lemonade. Mrs. Johnson brought a big blanket to sit on.",
            p2: "When they arrived at the park, the children, Lily and Ben, immediately ran to the playground. Lily loved the swings. She went higher and higher, feeling the wind in her hair. Ben preferred the slide. He climbed up the ladder and slid down again and again, laughing each time.",
            p3: "After playing for a while, the family found a nice spot under a large oak tree. They spread out their blanket and enjoyed their picnic lunch. While eating, they watched ducks swimming in the nearby pond. An old man was feeding the ducks with bread crumbs.",
            p4: "After lunch, Mr. Johnson took the children for a walk around the park. They saw many interesting things: people walking their dogs, children riding bicycles, and families playing games. They even saw a squirrel running up a tree with a nut in its mouth.",
            p5: "Mrs. Johnson stayed on the blanket and read her book. She enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere and the warm sunshine. Sometimes she looked up from her book to watch her family having fun together.",
            p6: "As the afternoon went on, the park became busier. More families arrived, and the playground got crowded. The Johnsons decided it was time to go home. Before leaving, they made sure to clean up their area, putting all their trash in the bin.",
            p7: "On the drive home, Lily and Ben talked excitedly about their day. Lily said the swings were her favorite part. Ben said he liked the slide best. Both children asked when they could visit the park again. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson smiled at each other, happy that their family had enjoyed such a wonderful day together."
